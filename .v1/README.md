## Crestfall

### Overview

Crestfall is an open-source alternative for some parts of Firebase and Supabase.

### Focus on your users and your business, leave the back-end infrstructure to us.

- We want you to worry about delivering value to your end-users through great user experiences, products, and services. Let Crestfall handle the rest such as Authentication, Authorization, REST API, Search API, Storage API, DNS, Web Hosting, and more.

### Monoliths first, microservices later.

- In monoliths, all services are in a single server instance. We scale it up (or vertically) by increasing the amount of CPU, RAM, and Disk in a single server instance.
- In microservices, all services are isolated from each other on their own virtual machine, container, or server instance. We scale it out (or horizontally) by increasing the amount of instances to spread the workload across multiple machines.
- We want our users to take advantage of monolithic architectures (which comes with better latency and interoperability) until they need to use microservices according to their business needs. This is economical for small businesses, early stage startups, small teams, and solo developers who have one thing in common: small amount of active users.

### Avoid vendor lock-in. Seriously.

- We want our users to be able to easily move their back-end infrastructure across cloud vendors who offer managed hosting, or into their own servers for self-hosting. We understand that reasons may vary ranging from better costs, better performance, or even better privacy and security.
